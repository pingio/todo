# Todo
A simple todo/kanban project managing app for windows.

## Getting Started
Todo runs on .NET Framework 4.7, so make sure you have that.  
After that simply pull the project, restore dependencies, and get started.

## Building 
For now Todo uses ClickOnce to deploy, but this is planned to change.  
You can either deploy todo as ClickOnce application or simply use the output from the builds, but this wont associate .todo files with the application.
